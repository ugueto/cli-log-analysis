Steps:

1. Parse arguments directly from the Command Line using the argparse Python library.

Single-dash for one letter arguments and double-dash for multiple letter arguments.

Operations:
-> All operations -a argument
-> Seconds -s argument : Events per second are considered as an average of events done per second in the entire file. *Transform to datetime (import datetime + datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp( # epoch_time here ))
-> Most Frequent IP --mfip argument
-> Least Frequent IP --lfip argument
-> Total amount of bytes exchanged --be argument : sum of Response header size and Response size in each log.
 
2. Convert input file into a pandas DataFrame, in order to perform operations (file_converter.py).

3. Perform operations on the input file.

4. Return results in a JSON format.
